# docker-machine-driver-packet
Packet bare-metal cloud driver for Docker Machine called 

> Driver name: `packet`

### Usage

You can provision bare-metal hosts once you have built and installed the docker-machine driver. The binary will be placed in your `$PATH` directory.

Test that the installation worked by typing in:

```
$ docker-machine create --driver packet
```

#### Example usage:

This creates the following: 

* Type0 machine
* in the EWR region (NJ)
* with Ubuntu 16.04
* in project $PROJECT
* Using $API_KEY - [get yours from the Portal](https://app.packet.net/portal#/api-keys)

```
$ docker-machine create sloth \
  --driver packet --packet-api-key=$API_KEY --packet-os=ubuntu_16_04 --packet-project-id=$PROJECT --packet-facility-code "ewr1" --packet-plan "baremetal_0"

```

> Provision time can take several minutes

At this point you can now `docker-machine env sloth` and then start using your Docker bare-metal host!

### Building

Pre-reqs: `docker-machine` and `make`

* Install the Golang SDK [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/) (at least 1.11 required for [modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support

* Download the source-code with
  `git clone http://github.com/packethost/docker-machine-driver-packet.git`

* Build and install the driver:

```
$ cd docker-machine-driver-packet
$ make 
$ sudo make install
```

Now you will now be able to specify a `-driver` of `packet` to `docker-machine` commands.
