The [Packet](https://packet.com) cloud bare-metal machine driver for Docker.

This repository is [Maintained](https://github.com/packethost/standards/blob/main/maintained-statement.md) meaning that this software is supported by Packet and its community - available to use in production environments.

## Usage

You can provision bare-metal hosts once you have built and installed the docker-machine driver. The binary will be placed in your `$PATH` directory.

Test that the installation worked by typing in:

```sh
docker-machine create --driver packet
```

### Example usage

This creates the following:

* Type0 machine
* in the EWR region (NJ)
* with Ubuntu 16.04
* in project $PROJECT
* Using $API_KEY - [get yours from the Portal](https://app.packet.net/users/me/api-keys)

```sh
$ docker-machine create sloth \
  --driver packet --packet-api-key=$API_KEY --packet-os=ubuntu_16_04 --packet-project-id=$PROJECT --packet-facility-code "ewr1" --packet-plan "baremetal_0"
  
Creating CA: /home/alex/.docker/machine/certs/ca.pem
Creating client certificate: /home/alex/.docker/machine/certs/cert.pem

To see how to connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine running on this virtual machine, run: docker-machine env sloth
```

> Provision time can take several minutes

At this point you can now `docker-machine env sloth` and then start using your Docker bare-metal host!

## Development

### Building

Pre-reqs: `docker-machine` and `make`

* Install the Golang SDK [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/) (at least 1.11 required for [modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support

* Download the source-code with `git clone http://github.com/packethost/docker-machine-driver-packet.git`

* Build and install the driver:

```sh
cd docker-machine-driver-packet
make
sudo make install
```

Now you will now be able to specify a `-driver` of `packet` to `docker-machine` commands.

### Debugging

To monitor the Docker debugging details and the Packet API calls:

```sh
go build
PACKNGO_DEBUG=1 PATH=`pwd`:$PATH docker-machine \
  --debug create -d packet \
  --packet-api-key=$PACKET_TOKEN \
  --packet-project-id=$PACKET_PROJECT \
  foo
```
